##Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

1. Subject: the integer subject ID.
2. Activity: the string activity name:
*Walking
*Walking Upstairs
*Walking Downstairs
*Sitting
*Standing
*Laying

##Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
